\title{Identifies all R / L interactions}
\usage{
calc_rl_connections(
  input,
  nodes,
  group_by = FALSE,
  weight_by_proportion = FALSE,
  print_progress = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{input}{the input ex_sc}

\item{nodes}{the pData variable used in calc_agg_bulk that will be used to place nodes (such as cluster or cell type)}

\item{group_by}{the pData columns calc_agg_bulk was calculated on to split the networks
into independent networks (such as an experimental condition)}

\item{weight_by_proportion}{if true will multiple ligand mean expression within a node by the proportion of that group}
}
\description{
This function will map all RL interactions
}
\details{
This will use the calc_agg_bulk results to ID networks
}
\examples{
ex_sc_example <- id_rl(input = ex_sc_example)
}
